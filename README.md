# Mastermind's Voice

Created using both vite and `create-svelte`... somehow

## Technical Info

- **stack**: Svelte, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, Vite
- **authors**: @painatalman and @JamieBurridge

## Get Started

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Build

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
